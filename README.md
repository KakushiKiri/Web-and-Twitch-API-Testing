#### Web Design/Twitch API Testing

This is primarily a personal project to create a website displaying a streamer's social media, and and details required; It also  
contains a database which stores (in this case) karaoke songs with the title, language, genre, and artist.  

The purpose is to allow viewers of said streamer access their website and search through the songs included in the database via one of the
website extensions. This will directly connect to Twitch API; When a viewer redeems a song, it will automatically search and add the song to a queue visible on the backend of the site.
